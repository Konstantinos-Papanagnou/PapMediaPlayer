Pap Media Player is an application written in C# with Xamarin Framework that reads mp3 files from the internal storage of a device as well as the external storage of a device and lists them. 
You can view the songs based on the folders they are located, all of them at once, or even create your own playlists.
Install the apk located in the Releases folder on your phone and you should be ready to go. (Note that the search can take a while depending on the count of songs you have)


The app is still under development but the main functionallity is completed and bug free.
